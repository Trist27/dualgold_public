## Introduction
In the realm of investment, gold and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin represent complementary assets rather than competitors. Our approach integrates these two by exploiting their unique store values characteristics and performance potential in a robust investment strategy particularly suited for turbulent economic conditions.
- **Diversification**: Combines the best of both worldsâ€”traditional and digital investments.
- **Inflation Hedge**: Acts as a dual hedge against inflation with both digital and physical assets.
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Offers potentially higher returns for managed levels of risk.

## Strategy Overview

### Portfolio Composition
- **50% Gold**: Stabilizes the portfolio against market fluctuations.
- **50% Cryptocurrencies**: Enhances potential gains through volatility. This includes:
  - 25% Bitcoin
  - 25% Alternative cryptocurrencies

## Performance
Compared to a passive 80/20 allocation our model include 
- **Rebalancing and downside protection**
The portfolio is rebalanced monthly based on proprietary risk metrics. This ensures an optimal blend of digital and physical assets, enhancing overall performance while maintaining stringent risk control measures.
Risk is evaluated using proprietary forward looking metrics aiming at improving risk management and reducing drawdownscompared to standard methods.
- **Alt coins potential**
Alternative cryptocurrencies to bitcoin may offer attractive risk-reward profiles. Our model opportunistically diversify away from bitcoin to such cryptocurrencies, with a stringent risk control and drawdowns control mechanism for a long term capital preservation.
